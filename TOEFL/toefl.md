## 口语

### 第一题

person, place, activity, suggestion

__education__

College education plays an important role in a person's career success.

Take me as an example. If I had not received a college education, I would not have been exposed to advanced courses that would benefit my future career, such as data structures, linear algebra, etc.

Colledge education also develops us the interpersonal skills. Personally speaking, I learned how to collaborate and commucate with my fellow students as we work together on our class projects. I believe that the ability to work together is crucial to our future career development. 

__success__

I don't reckon having money and power is the best definition of success. Although having money and power means that a person can afford more consumer goods, lead a luxury lifestyle and enjoy more privilege in certain areas. However there are so many other things that matter.

Take my graudate advisor as an example. Although he is not as rich as most of famous entrepreneurs. But he gathered a group of talented people, and brought their ingenuity into play. He eventually made a breakthrough in the field of high technolog and contributed to the progress of society. I think his life can be rated as a successful one.

### essay1

Education, ==the foundation of a quality life,== __has been valued and even triggered a heated discussion over__ whether students should take courses online or in classrooms. Learning in traditional classroom, __in some people's views__, continues to be an effective way. __Contrary to these people's opinions is my perspective that__ online learning, ==which requires students to attend classes on computers or televisions,== is superior, __due to__ the contributions to their academic performance and personal development.

__What must be prioritized is that__ taking distance-learning courses, ==instead of having courses in traditional classrooms,== is beneficial to students' academic learning, __by__ offering them more knowledge and triggering their enthusiasm in learning. __To begin with,__ it is online education that provides students with the access to a large quantity of expertise. __In detail,__ on the Internet, students can acquire a wide range of knowledge in history, art and science, enlarging their knowledge base; __in contrast__, such a large amount of knowledge cannot be obtained when they are instructed by only one teacher in concrete classrooms. __Moreover,__ never can we ignore the significance of distance education to students' interest in learning. __To explain it further,__ by receiving education on the Internet, students will find it more interesting to deal with mathematical problems, do research, and write proposals; __on the other hand,__ will they be passionate about these tasks when teachers always lecture in brick-and-mortar classrooms?

__What should be equally worth discussing is that__ receiving distance education, ==rather than having tradition face-to-face courses,== can promote students'personal development, __by__ honing their interpersonal skills and cultivating their persistence. __To begin with,__ it is well-acknowledged that educated on the Internet, students can practice their communication skills. __Specifically,__ only in online learning environments will students come across people from diverse backgrounds, such as classmates, instructors and school administrators, with whom they can practice their tactics of socializing; __on the contrary,__ under no circumstances will they interact with such a variety of people if they are educated in traditional classroom settings. __Additionally,__ when having a distance education program, students will become more determined. __To be more specific,__ the more distance-learning courses they take on the Internet, the more distractions they will be exposed to, stimulating them to resist temptations and foster their persistence; __however,__ it is impossible for them to encounter these lures in traditional classrooms.

Academic performance, __the foundation of students' future development,__ will be boosted when they receive online education. Personal development, __essential contributors to students' future success,__ will be facilitated, if they are educated on the Internet. __To conclude, only by__ having distance education, __instead of__ being taught in classroom, __can__ students reap numerous benefits.

### essay2

Meals, the foundation of people's life, is gathering more and more attention, even triggering the discussion over whether it is important to have regular family meals together. In some people's view, family keep a regualr routine to eat meals together is of little value. Contrary to these people's optinions is my perspective that it is worthwile for every family members to sacriface their personal time and eat meals together, due to the contirbutions to their health condition and family relationship.

What must be prioritized is that eating meals with family, instead of eating alone, is beneficial for their health condition, including both physical and mental health. To begin with, what shouldn't be neglected is that eating at home is good to our body. In detail, at home, we can acquire fresh vegetables, carefully washed meet and neutrual balanced food; in contrast, such good food supplies are hardly obtained if we eat outside. Moreover, eating at home also contributes to our mental health. To explain it futher, when family get together, we can recall lots of happy moments, e.g. careless childhood, harmony family travels and parents' sweet weeding, which can relief us from the burden of work and consequently benefits to our mental health; will people recall these happy times if he eats alone?

What should be equally worth discussing is that having meals with families, rather than having meals alone, contributes to our internship, by exchanging daily information and offering helps. To begin with, it is well-acknowledged that eating with family can share our daily life. Specifically, eating at home people exchange informations, including recent health condition, childreen school behavior and adults career promotion, which increase infinity to family members; on the contrary, if family members  eat seperately, these information will never be shared. Additionally, when family eat together, they will have more chances to solve problems together. To be more specific, at a family meal, people are always couraged to share their problems, and his family are willing to provide sincere and thoughtful solutions, which makes the problems more likely to be solved effectively; however these problems are impossible to be handled properly if we eat outside alone.

Health, the foundation of people's work and life, can be obtained by having a regualr family meals. Internship, the essential contributor for people's development, can be prompted by eating together with their family. To conclude only eating with our family, instead of eating outside alone, can maximize benefits.
